| January 12 |  7:00-7:30pm  |                                                                                          I started by cloning the repository and checking what I was returning and to see if there were any other details. I was really confused at first because I couldn't think of a way to solve the problem more efficiently than the brute force solution. I thought a little bit about storing how long it took to get from one node to another, as I was inspired by textcompressor where we stored all of the prefixes we had, but I scrapped the idea since it would still require getting all of the combinations and I just confused myself a lot. |

Even though it was hard to understand, I noticed that it was kind of similar to my old idea. But instead of trying to brute force the idea to life, I decided to try to come up with something copmpletely new since I knew that the algorithm used something that we haven't learned yet. I began by thinking in the realm of graph theory, since that was the hint you gave us, but I couldn't come up with anything else by the end of class. |

So, I strayed away from graph theory and tried to think about it in a new lens which was harder than I thought. I wasn't even sure if the solution had to do with storing all of the paths you make in a data structure. |
| January 14 | 10:00-10:40pm | Tonight, I remembered our highways and hospitals problem set. The main idea of it was to add every node to the largest cluster until you had the smallest amount of clusters. I remembered it because I thought slowly adding nodes together to make the longest chain sounded similar to the problem set but I didn't continue the idea for long becaues it was just confusing me. I also randomly thought of just sorting the array and looking at the difference between the new and old array, but I quickly scrapped the idea. Overall, this problem set is really stumping me, and I couldn't really think of a solid way to solve it :( |
