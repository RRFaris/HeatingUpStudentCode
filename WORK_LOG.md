| January 12 |  7:00-7:30pm  |                                                                                               I started by cloning the repository and checking what I was returning and to see if there were any other details. I was really confused at first because I couldn't think of a way to solve the problem more efficiently than the brute force solution. I thought a little bit about storing how long it took to get from one node to another, as I was inspired by textcompressor where we stored all of the prefixes we had, but I scrapped the idea since it would still require getting all of the combinations and I just confused myself a lot. |
| January 13 | 11:18-11:55am |                                                                                                                                       In class, I listened to what Lucas and Jack were cooking up. Even though it was hard to understand, I noticed that it was kind of similar to my old idea. But instead of trying to brute force the idea to life, I decided to try to come up with something copmpletely new since I knew that the algorithm used something that we haven't learned yet. I began by thinking in the realm of graph theory, since that was the hint you gave us, but I couldn't come up with anything else by the end of class. |
| January 13 | 9:30-10:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      At home, I resumed thinking about the problem through a graph theory lens by thinking of different ways to store edges like a modified linked list but I never really went anywhere with those ideas. So, I strayed away from graph theory and tried to think about it in a new lens which was harder than I thought. I wasn't even sure if the solution had to do with storing all of the paths you make in a data structure. |
| January 14 | 10:00-10:40pm |      Tonight, I remembered our highways and hospitals problem set. The main idea of it was to add every node to the largest cluster until you had the smallest amount of clusters. I remembered it because I thought slowly adding nodes together to make the longest chain sounded similar to the problem set but I didn't continue the idea for long becaues it was just confusing me. I also randomly thought of just sorting the array and looking at the difference between the new and old array, but I quickly scrapped the idea. Overall, this problem set is really stumping me, and I couldn't really think of a solid way to solve it :( |
| January 16 |  2:10-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                        In class, I began by creating my adjacency list using an array of arrays. It actually took me a few tries to get this right since I couldn't figure out the correct syntax but I eventually got it. Then, I created my loop to got through every node and perform the recursive algorithm that would return the longest path. Finally, I almost finished the longest path method. I wasn't really able to test anything in class because I had nothing ready to test at all. |
| January 18 |  6:08-6-40pm  | I began by finishing the longest path method and testing to see if my code worked. Unsurprisingly, it didn't work first try. However, I was getting a weird error that was something like this: adjacencyList[i] is not defined. I got really confused and I stared at the code for a while. I tried using the debugger to find the issue, but it didn't seem to help much in this case. Finally, I realized that not only do I have to initialize the array, I have to initialize each ArrayList object inside of the array using a for loop. Yes debugging this took me 32 minutes. Looking back, I don't know how I didn't realize this earlier. |
| January 18 |  7:30-7:50pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       My code still didn't work after I solved that issue. When I looked at my new error, I quickly realized that I was adding the actual temperature to the list, not its index because my error was something like: index out of bounds error for index 73 in length 3. After fixing that, it worked. Now, I just need add memoization to make it more efficient. |
| January 18 |  7:50-8:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                 To do memoization, I looked back at the slides to see what components I needed. I began by creating the array where I would store all the longest lengths to each temperature. Then, I made sure to add the longest length for each temperature to the array after completing recursion. Finally, I added an if statement that checked if I had already been to a node before. At first, it didn't work, but I quickly realized that I accidentally switched the if statement logic, and it worked! |
